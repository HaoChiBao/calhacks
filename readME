# ✈️ Era — Imagine. Plan. Book.  
### *The New Era of Travel.*

---

## 🌟 Inspiration  

Era was born out of necessity — during exam season, our team scrambled to plan a last-minute trip to **CalHacks**. Between juggling coursework, booking flights, and finding hotels, we realized how **fragmented and chaotic** trip planning truly is.  

We asked ourselves:  
> *What if planning a trip could feel as easy as chatting with a friend?*  

That question sparked **Era**, an all-in-one AI-powered travel assistant that helps you **imagine, plan, and book trips in minutes — not hours.**

## 💡 What It Does  

Era is an **AI travel planner** that combines conversational intelligence with visual design.  
Instead of switching between 5–8 different tools for flights, hotels, and itineraries, users simply **chat** with Era’s built-in travel agent to:  

- 🌍 Generate **personalized itineraries** in seconds  
- 🏨 Explore **real-time hotels and attractions**  
- 🗺️ Visualize trips on an **interactive map interface**  

Era’s **block-based visual UI** lets travelers drag, edit, and view their plans spatially — turning trip planning into a creative, intuitive experience.

## 🧱 How We Built It  

**Frontend:**  
- Built using **React**, **Vite**, **TypeScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** for a modular, fast, and visually rich UI.  

**Backend:**  
- Powered by **Express.js** for routing, API handling, and managing async requests.  

**Real-Time Data:**  
- Integrated **SerpAPI** to fetch live information about hotels, restaurants, and attractions.  

**AI Integration:**  
- Leveraged the **OpenAI GPT-4 API** to generate personalized travel recommendations, itineraries, and contextual responses.  

**Maps & Visualization:**  
- Implemented **Google Maps API** to dynamically render routes, markers, and geospatial data.  

**Deployment:**  
- Hosted on **Vercel** for continuous deployment and seamless performance during hackathon iterations.  

**Languages & Frameworks:**  
- JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, React
